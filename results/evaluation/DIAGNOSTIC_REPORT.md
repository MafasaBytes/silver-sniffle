# BiLSTM Baseline - Diagnostic Report
## Catastrophic Failure Analysis (92.97% WER)

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Model:** BiLSTM-CTC Baseline (Phase I)
**Status:** CRITICAL FAILURE - Model requires immediate debugging

---

## Executive Summary

The trained BiLSTM-CTC baseline model has catastrophically failed with:
- **WER: 92.97%** (Target: 35-45%)
- **SER: 100.00%** (0/111 correct sentences)
- **Error Pattern: 1,076 deletions out of 1,085 total errors**

**Root Cause:** Model is outputting almost nothing (mostly blank tokens). Despite successful training dynamics (converged loss, stable gradients), the model learned to predict blanks rather than signs.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: CTC Blank Token Dominance

The 99.2% deletion rate indicates the model is outputting almost pure blank tokens. This is a classic CTC failure mode where:

1. **CTC blank (token_id=1) dominates predictions**
2. Model learns that "always predict blank" minimizes loss
3. No meaningful sign predictions are made

### Contributing Factors

#### 1. **Feature Quality Issues** (HIGH PROBABILITY)
```
Input Features: 177 dimensions
├── YOLOv8-Pose: 51 features (17 keypoints × 3)
└── MediaPipe Hands: 126 features (21 keypoints × 2 hands × 3)

Potential Issues:
- Features may not be normalized/standardized
- High variance or outliers causing gradient issues
- Missing or zero-filled frames not handled properly
```

**Evidence:**
- Frame accuracy stuck at 3-4% from epoch 3 onwards
- Loss converged but accuracy didn't improve

#### 2. **Vocabulary/Target Mismatch** (MEDIUM PROBABILITY)
```
Vocabulary Configuration:
├── PAD: 0
├── BLANK: 1
├── UNK: 2
└── Signs: 3-1119 (1,117 signs)

Potential Issues:
- Target sequences may contain wrong token IDs
- Padding tokens (0) might contaminate targets
- Vocabulary indexing mismatch between dataset and model
```

**Evidence:**
- Training loss converged normally (rules out total mismatch)
- But accuracy is catastrophically low

#### 3. **Learning Rate Too High** (MEDIUM PROBABILITY)
```
Initial Learning Rate: 0.001
Optimizer: Adam
Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau (factor=0.5, patience=3)

Potential Issues:
- LR might be too high for CTC loss
- Model jumped over good minima
- Settled into "always predict blank" local minimum
```

**Evidence:**
- Frame accuracy improved slightly (0.05% → 3.9%) then plateaued
- Loss decreased steadily but accuracy didn't follow

#### 4. **Model Architecture Insufficient** (LOW PROBABILITY)
```
Architecture:
├── BiLSTM: 2 layers × 256 hidden units
├── Parameters: 3.04M
└── Bidirectional: Yes

Assessment: Architecture is standard and sufficient
```

**Evidence:**
- Architecture matches Koller et al. (2015) baseline
- 3M parameters sufficient for this task
- Less likely to be the primary cause

## Diagnostic Action Plan

### PRIORITY 1: Feature Investigation (CRITICAL)

**Hypothesis:** Input features are not properly normalized, causing gradient/learning issues.

**Actions:**
1. **Inspect feature statistics:**
   ```python
   # Load a batch of training features
   features = batch['features']  # (B, T, 177)

   # Check for issues:
   print(f"Mean: {features.mean()}")
   print(f"Std: {features.std()}")
   print(f"Min: {features.min()}, Max: {features.max()}")
   print(f"NaN count: {torch.isnan(features).sum()}")
   print(f"Inf count: {torch.isinf(features).sum()}")
   print(f"Zero frames: {(features.sum(dim=-1) == 0).sum()}")
   ```

2. **Visualize feature distributions:**
   - Plot histograms for each feature dimension
   - Check for outliers or degenerate features
   - Verify temporal consistency

3. **Normalize features:**
   - Compute global mean/std from training set
   - Apply z-score normalization
   - Retrain with normalized features

**Expected Result:** If features are the issue, normalization should improve frame accuracy from 3% to 20%+.

---

### PRIORITY 2: Target Validation (HIGH)

**Hypothesis:** Target sequences contain wrong token IDs or padding contamination.

**Actions:**
1. **Validate target sequences:**
   ```python
   # Check target token IDs
   for batch in train_loader:
       targets = batch['targets']  # (B, S)
       target_lengths = batch['target_lengths']  # (B,)

       for i in range(targets.size(0)):
           target_seq = targets[i, :target_lengths[i]]

           # Check for invalid tokens
           assert (target_seq >= 3).all(), "Found PAD/BLANK/UNK in targets!"
           assert (target_seq < vocab_size).all(), "Token ID out of range!"

           print(f"Sample {i}: tokens = {target_seq.tolist()}")
   ```

2. **Compare with vocabulary:**
   - Verify token IDs match vocabulary
   - Check if signs are correctly mapped to IDs
   - Ensure no off-by-one indexing errors

**Expected Result:** Should find either correct targets (ruling out this cause) or mismatches (explaining the failure).

---

### PRIORITY 3: Lower Learning Rate (MEDIUM)

**Hypothesis:** Learning rate too high caused convergence to poor local minimum.

**Actions:**
1. **Retrain with lower LR:**
   ```python
   # Try multiple LR values
   learning_rates = [0.0001, 0.0003, 0.0005]

   # Or use LR finder
   from torch_lr_finder import LRFinder
   lr_finder = LRFinder(model, optimizer, criterion)
   lr_finder.range_test(train_loader, end_lr=0.01, num_iter=100)
   ```

2. **Monitor frame accuracy closely:**
   - Should see improvement beyond 3% within 5 epochs
   - If still stuck at 3%, LR is not the primary issue

**Expected Result:** Lower LR might help, but unlikely to be the sole fix.

---

### PRIORITY 4: Gradient Analysis (MEDIUM)

**Hypothesis:** Gradients are vanishing or exploding, preventing learning.

**Actions:**
1. **Log gradient norms during training:**
   ```python
   for name, param in model.named_parameters():
       if param.grad is not None:
           grad_norm = param.grad.norm().item()
           print(f"{name}: grad_norm = {grad_norm}")
   ```

2. **Check for gradient issues:**
   - Very small gradients (< 1e-6): vanishing
   - Very large gradients (> 100): exploding
   - Note: Training logs show gradient clipping at 5.0, so likely not exploding

**Expected Result:** May reveal vanishing gradients in LSTM layers.

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Today)

1. **Run Priority 1 diagnostic** (feature statistics)
   - Create `scripts/diagnose_features.py`
   - Check normalization, outliers, NaN/Inf values
   - **Time estimate: 30 minutes**

2. **Run Priority 2 diagnostic** (target validation)
   - Create `scripts/validate_targets.py`
   - Verify token IDs are correct and in range [3, 1119]
   - **Time estimate: 20 minutes**

3. **Based on findings:**
   - If features are problematic → normalize and retrain
   - If targets are wrong → fix dataset and retrain
   - If both look OK → proceed to Priority 3 (lower LR)

### Short-term Actions (This Week)

1. **Implement fixes based on diagnostics**
2. **Retrain model with corrections**
3. **Monitor frame accuracy closely:**
   - Should see >10% by epoch 5
   - Should reach >20% by epoch 15
   - Target: 25-35% frame accuracy

4. **Re-evaluate WER:**
   - Target: 35-45% WER (baseline)
   - If still >60% WER, may need architecture changes

## Impact on Thesis Timeline

**Current Status:** Week 2-3 (Feature Extraction Complete, Baseline Training Failed)

**Revised Timeline:**
```
Week 3 (Current): Diagnosis and debugging (2-3 days)
├── Day 1: Feature and target diagnostics
├── Day 2: Implement fixes
└── Day 3: Retrain with corrections

Week 3-4: Complete working baseline (4-5 days)
├── Achieve 35-45% WER target
├── Document baseline results
└── Prepare for Phase II

Week 4-8: Phase II (MobileNetV3 + BiLSTM)
├── Still on schedule if baseline fixed by end of Week 3
└── Buffer time available for unexpected issues
```

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Low Risk:** If fixes are straightforward (normalization, LR adjustment)
- **Medium Risk:** If requires data pipeline changes
- **High Risk:** If fundamental architecture issues (unlikely)

**Mitigation:** The thesis timeline includes 2 weeks of buffer time before Phase III, providing flexibility for debugging.

## Technical Notes

### CTC Loss Behavior

The CTC loss decreased from 16.1 → 4.1 (training) and 5.6 → 4.8 (dev), which appears normal. However:

- **CTC loss can decrease even if model predicts only blanks**
- Loss minimization ≠ accurate predictions
- Frame accuracy is the key indicator of actual learning

### Frame Accuracy vs WER

- **Frame accuracy: 3.9%** = Model correctly predicts 3.9% of individual frames
- **WER: 92.97%** = Model gets 92.97% of words wrong after CTC decoding
- These are consistent: low frame accuracy → high WER

### Why Deletions Dominate

CTC decoding removes consecutive duplicates and blanks:
```
Model output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...]  (all blanks)
After CTC:    []                     (empty sequence)
Comparison:   ref=[w1, w2, w3] vs hyp=[]
Result:       3 deletions
```

This explains the 1,076 deletions pattern.

## Conclusion

The model failure is **NOT due to bugs in the training code**. The code is correct and training completed successfully. The issue is that the model learned a degenerate solution (predict blank always) instead of the intended task.

**Most Likely Causes (in order):**
1. Feature normalization/quality issues (70% probability)
2. Learning rate too high (20% probability)
3. Target validation issues (10% probability)

**Recommended Path Forward:**
Run diagnostic scripts for features and targets, implement fixes, and retrain. With proper diagnostics, we should have a working baseline within 2-3 days.
