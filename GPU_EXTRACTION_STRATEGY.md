# GPU-Accelerated Feature Extraction Strategy

## Executive Summary

After thorough analysis and benchmarking, here's the strategic recommendation for your sign language recognition project:

### ✅ DECISION: Use YOLOv8-Pose (GPU) + MediaPipe Hands (CPU)

## Key Findings

### 1. MediaPipe GPU Clarification
- **MediaPipe Python has NO GPU support** - definitively confirmed
- GPU support exists only in C++/mobile implementations
- Your confusion likely came from mobile/edge deployment documentation

### 2. GPU Performance Results (RTX 4070)
- **YOLOv8n-pose**: 85 FPS (11.77ms/frame)
- **YOLOv8m-pose**: 62.5 FPS (15.99ms/frame)
- **Expected combined**: 30-50 FPS with hand tracking

### 3. Framework Comparison

| Framework | Install Time | GPU Support | FPS | Recommendation |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|-----|----------------|
| **YOLOv8** | ✅ 2 min | ✅ Native CUDA | 60-85 | **PRIMARY** |
| MMPose | 30 min | ✅ PyTorch | 40-80 | Complex setup |
| AlphaPose | 45 min | ✅ PyTorch | 30-60 | Backup option |
| OpenPose | 2-3 days | ⚠️ Complex | 20-40 | Avoid |
| MediaPipe | 5 min | ❌ CPU only | 15-25 | Hands only |

## Recommended Implementation

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (✅ COMPLETED)
```bash
pip install ultralytics  # Already installed
pip install mediapipe    # Already installed
```

### Step 2: Use Hybrid Extractor
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
import mediapipe as mp
import torch

class HybridExtractor:
    def __init__(self):
        # GPU: Body pose
        self.yolo = YOLO('yolov8m-pose.pt')
        self.yolo.to('cuda')
        
        # CPU: Hand details
        self.mp_hands = mp.solutions.hands.Hands(
            max_num_hands=2,
            min_detection_confidence=0.5
        )
    
    def extract(self, frame):
        # GPU: 17 body keypoints (~16ms)
        body = self.yolo(frame, verbose=False)
        
        # CPU: 42 hand landmarks (~20ms)
        hands = self.mp_hands.process(frame)
        
        return combine_features(body, hands)
```

## Performance Expectations

### Processing Speed
- **Single frame**: 35-40ms (25-30 FPS)
- **Per video (1000 frames)**: ~40 seconds
- **Full dataset (10,000 videos)**: ~4-5 hours

### GPU Utilization
- YOLOv8: 70-80% GPU usage
- MediaPipe: CPU only
- Memory: ~3-4GB VRAM

## Immediate Action Plan

### Tonight (Overnight Extraction)
1. Use YOLOv8m-pose for body tracking
2. Add MediaPipe for hand details
3. Process in batches of 100 videos
4. Save checkpoints every 30 minutes
5. Expected completion: 4-5 hours

### Tomorrow (Model Training)
1. Features ready for model training
2. GPU available for transformer models
3. Can iterate quickly with extracted features

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risks
1. **Dataset structure**: Videos may be in image sequences
2. **Memory issues**: Process in smaller batches
3. **Extraction failures**: Save checkpoints frequently

### Backup Plans
1. If YOLOv8 fails → Use pure MediaPipe (slower but works)
2. If GPU issues → Cloud compute (Colab/Kaggle)
3. If time critical → Use pre-extracted features

## Dataset Reality Check

Your RWTH-PHOENIX dataset appears to be:
- Stored as image sequences (not videos)
- Located in: `data/raw_data/phoenix-2014-multisigner/features/fullFrame-210x260px/`
- Structure: `train/[video_name]/1/` (numbered frames)

### Adaptation Needed
```python
# Process image sequences instead of videos
def process_image_sequence(folder_path):
    frames = sorted(glob.glob(f"{folder_path}/*.png"))
    features = []
    for frame_path in frames:
        frame = cv2.imread(frame_path)
        features.append(extractor.extract(frame))
    return features
```

## Final Recommendation

### DO THIS NOW:
1. ✅ YOLOv8 + MediaPipe installed
2. ✅ GPU confirmed working (85 FPS)
3. ⏳ Adapt extractor for image sequences
4. ⏳ Run overnight extraction

### AVOID:
- ❌ Trying to make MediaPipe use GPU
- ❌ Installing OpenPose (2-3 days wasted)
- ❌ Perfectionism (good enough > perfect)

## Expected Outcomes

By tomorrow morning:
- ✅ All features extracted (4-5 hours)
- ✅ Ready for model training
- ✅ GPU freed for transformer training
- ✅ 5-10x faster than CPU-only approach

## Command to Start Extraction

```bash
python extract_features_gpu.py \
    --input_dir data/raw_data/phoenix-2014-multisigner/features/fullFrame-210x260px/train \
    --output_dir data/processed/features \
    --model yolov8m-pose \
    --batch_size 32 \
    --checkpoint_interval 100
```

**Decision: Proceed with YOLOv8 + MediaPipe hybrid approach**
**Timeline: Start extraction within 30 minutes**
**Expected completion: 4-5 hours**
