## Extraction Plan

### Splits to Extract

| Split | Total Samples | Already Extracted | Remaining | Est. Time |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Train | 4,376 | 71 | 4,305 | ~9.5 hours |
| Dev | 111 | 0 | 111 | ~15 minutes |
| Test | 180 | 0 | 180 | ~24 minutes |
| **Total** | **4,667** | **71** | **4,596** | **~10 hours** |

### Features
- **Per sample**: 1,662-dimensional MediaPipe Holistic features
- **Components**: Pose (132) + Face (1,404) + Left Hand (63) + Right Hand (63)
- **Storage**: ~2.2 MB per video
- **Total storage**: ~10.2 GB for full dataset

---

## Resume Capability

The extraction script has built-in resume functionality:
- Checks for already-extracted `.npy` files
- Skips samples that exist
- Creates checkpoints every 100 samples
- Safe to interrupt and restart

**To resume if interrupted**:
```bash
python src/extract_full_dataset.py
```

---

## Monitoring Progress

### Check Current Status
```bash
# Count extracted samples
ls data/processed/train/*.npy | wc -l
ls data/processed/dev/*.npy | wc -l
ls data/processed/test/*.npy | wc -l
```

### View Latest Checkpoint
```bash
# Check latest checkpoint file
ls data/processed/train/checkpoint_*.json | tail -1
cat $(ls data/processed/train/checkpoint_*.json | tail -1)
```

### Report Contents
- Processing statistics (frames, time, FPS)
- Memory usage analysis
- Video characteristics (frames per video)
- Success/failure breakdown
- Any error logs

## Next Steps (After Extraction Completes)

1. **Validate Extraction** ✓
   - Verify all 4,667 files exist
   - Check file integrity
   - Review extraction report

2. **Test Dataset Loader** ✓ (Already created)
   ```bash
   python src/phoenix_dataset.py
   ```

3. **Week 2: Targeted EDA**
   - Temporal analysis on extracted features
   - Spatial analysis (keypoint stability)
   - Vocabulary analysis (class imbalance)
   - Feature discriminability studies

4. **Week 2-3: BiLSTM-CTC Baseline**
   - Implement baseline model
   - Train on pre-extracted features
   - Validate CTC convergence
   - Establish performance floor (target: 35-40% WER)

## Scripts Created

### Extraction Scripts
- `src/extract_full_dataset.py` - Full dataset extraction with resume
- `src/batch_feature_extraction.py` - Batch processing (used for initial 71)
- `src/mediapipe_feature_extractor.py` - Single video extraction

### Dataset Utilities
- `src/phoenix_dataset.py` - PyTorch Dataset loader
  - Loads pre-extracted `.npy` features
  - Handles variable-length sequences
  - Implements vocabulary encoding/decoding
  - Provides DataLoader with proper collation

### Analysis Scripts
- `src/dataset_explorer.py` - Dataset statistics and validation

## Performance Metrics (from validation)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| MediaPipe FPS | 13.87 |
| Processing Speed | 19-21 FPS average |
| Memory per video | ~197 MB |
| Feature size | 2.2 MB per video |
| Feature dimensions | (num_frames, 1662) |

## Option A: Offline Training Strategy ✓

**Decision**: Pre-extract all features for training phase

**Rationale**:
- Training phase has no real-time constraint
- Avoids repeated feature extraction during training
- Allows focus on model quality first
- Real-time optimization deferred to Phase III (deployment)

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- ~10 hours upfront extraction time
- ~10.2 GB storage required
- Real-time validation delayed until deployment phase

**Benefits**:
- No compromise on training data quality
- Faster training iterations (no extraction overhead)
- Can experiment with different architectures without re-extraction
- Baseline model can be trained immediately after extraction
