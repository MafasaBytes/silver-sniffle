# GPU Extraction Status

**Started**: October 14, 2025 at 15:29 UTC
**Process ID**: 874946 (background bash)
**Status**: RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY ✅

---

## Current Progress

**Files extracted**: 4/4376 train samples (0.1%)
**Performance**:
- FPS: 12-14 FPS (within expected range after warmup)
- GPU utilization: 0.1/6.1GB VRAM (efficient!)
- Processing time: 10-14 seconds per sample
- Failed samples: 0

**Estimated completion**:
- Train split: ~13 hours (4,376 samples at 11-14s each)
- Dev split: +20 minutes (111 samples)
- Test split: +30 minutes (180 samples)
- **Total: ~14 hours**

## Performance Analysis

From current metrics:
```
Sample 1: 14.70s (with GPU warmup)
Sample 2: 11.27s (warmed up)
Sample 3: 11.82s
Sample 4: 10.86s

Average after warmup: ~11.3 seconds/sample
```

**Why slower than expected?**
- Expected: 20-30 FPS = 5-10s per sample
- Actual: 12-14 FPS = 10-14s per sample

Possible reasons:
1. MediaPipe Hands (CPU) bottleneck is more significant than estimated
2. Frame count variation (some samples have 200+ frames)
3. Disk I/O for saving large numpy arrays
4. Initial batch processing overhead

**Still acceptable**: The extraction is running stably with no failures.

## Monitor Commands

### Check file count
```powershell
(Get-ChildItem data\processed\train\*.npy).Count
```

### Watch progress continuously
```powershell
while ($true) {
    cls
    $count = (Get-ChildItem data\processed\train\*.npy -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).Count
    $pct = [math]::Round(($count / 4376) * 100, 2)
    Write-Host "Extracted: $count/4376 ($pct%)"
    Write-Host "Estimated remaining: $([math]::Round((4376-$count) * 11.3 / 3600, 1)) hours"
    Start-Sleep 60
}
```

### Check latest checkpoint
```powershell
Get-ChildItem data\processed\train\checkpoint_yolov8_*.json |
    Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending |
    Select-Object -First 1 |
    Get-Content |
    ConvertFrom-Json
```

### View extraction log
```powershell
Get-Content extraction_output.log -Tail 20 -Wait
```

## What to Do

### NOW (while extraction runs):
1. ✅ Process is running stably in background
2. ✅ Output is logged to `extraction_output.log`
3. ✅ Resume capability enabled (checkpoints every 100 samples)

### OPTIONAL (monitoring):
- Check file count every hour
- Monitor GPU usage with `nvidia-smi`
- View log file periodically

### LATER (after completion):
1. Validate extraction:
   - Check file counts (4,376 + 111 + 180 = 4,667 total)
   - Verify feature dimensions (num_frames, 177)
   - Review summary statistics
2. Begin Week 2 tasks:
   - Train BiLSTM-CTC baseline
   - Prototype feature abstraction layer
   - Week 2 targeted EDA

---

## If Process Stops

The script has built-in resume capability. Just run it again:
```bash
python src/extract_features_yolov8_gpu.py --model yolov8m-pose.pt --split all
```

It will automatically skip already-extracted .npy files and continue from where it stopped.
