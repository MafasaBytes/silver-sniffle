## 1. Dataset Analysis

### 1.1 Split Statistics

| Split | Samples | Signers | Vocabulary | Sign Instances |
|-------|---------|---------|------------|----------------|
| Train | 4,376   | 8 (Signer01-09, excluding 05) | 1,117 | 49,966 |
| Dev   | 111     | 1 (Signer05) | 239 | 1,167 |

| **Total** | **4,667** | **9** | **1,135** | **52,034** |

**Key Insights**:
- Signer05 is unseen in training (true signer-independent evaluation)
- Train signers: Signer01, Signer02, Signer03, Signer04, Signer06, Signer07, Signer08, Signer09
- Significant class imbalance (top sign "REGEN" appears 2,502 times)

### 1.2 Sequence Characteristics (100 sample analysis)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mean frames per sequence | 143.2 |
| Median frames | 140.5 |
| Min-Max frames | 33-275 |
| Mean signs per annotation | 11.5 |
| Median signs | 11.0 |
| Min-Max signs | 3-19 |

**Implications**:
- Average video length: ~4.8 seconds @ 30 FPS
- Window size recommendation: 32-64 frames (1-2 seconds)
- CTC alignment challenge: 143 frames ‚Üí 11.5 signs (12.4:1 ratio)

### 1.3 Vocabulary Distribution

**Top 20 Most Frequent Signs**:
```
1. REGEN (rain): 2,502
2. __OFF__ (end marker): 2,193
3. __ON__ (start marker): 2,054
4. MORGEN (tomorrow): 969
5. SONNE (sun): 928
6. WOLKE (cloud): 927

## 3. Critical Risk Assessment

### 3.1 üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY RISK: Real-time Performance

**Finding**: MediaPipe processes at 13.87 FPS (53.8% below 30 FPS target)

**Root Causes**:
1. MediaPipe Holistic model_complexity=1 (medium)
2. Face mesh extraction (468 landmarks) is computationally expensive
3. Frame-by-frame processing without batching
4. PNG image loading overhead

**Impact**:
- Cannot achieve real-time processing with current setup
- Inference latency will be 2.16x higher than target

**Mitigation Strategies** (prioritized):

1. **Frame Sampling** (Easiest, ~3x speedup)
   - Process every 2nd or 3rd frame
   - Interpolate missing frames during inference
   - Trade-off: Potential loss of fine-grained temporal information

2. **Reduce MediaPipe Complexity** (Model parameter change)
   - Set `model_complexity=0` (lightweight mode)
   - Expected speedup: 1.5-2x
   - Trade-off: Slightly reduced landmark accuracy

3. **Selective Feature Extraction** (Architecture modification)
   - Disable face mesh (saves 1,404 dimensions)
   - Focus on pose + hands only (195 dimensions)
   - Expected speedup: 2-3x
   - Trade-off: Loss of facial expression information

4. **Pre-extract All Features Offline** (Recommended for training)
   - Extract features for entire dataset in advance
   - Cache to disk
   - Real-time constraint only applies to inference, not training
   - **Status**: 71/4,667 samples extracted (1.5% complete)

5. **Hardware Acceleration** (Long-term)
   - GPU acceleration for MediaPipe (requires TensorFlow GPU setup)
   - Model quantization
   - TensorRT optimization

**Recommended Approach**:
- **Training Phase**: Pre-extract all features offline (no real-time constraint)
- **Inference Phase**: Implement frame sampling (2-3 frames) + model_complexity=0
- **Expected Result**: 25-40 FPS (meets 30+ FPS target)

### 3.2 ‚úÖ LOW RISK: Memory Constraints

**Finding**: 197 MB per video sequence is acceptable for 8GB VRAM

**Analysis**:
- 197 MB / 176 frames = 1.12 MB per frame
- With batch size 4: ~800 MB (well within 8GB limit)
- Gradient checkpointing can reduce further if needed

**Status**: VALIDATED ‚úì

### 3.3 ‚úÖ LOW RISK: Dataset Integrity

**Finding**: 100% integrity on 100-sample test

**Status**: VALIDATED ‚úì

### 3.4 ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM RISK: CTC Convergence

**Concern**: 12.4:1 frame-to-sign ratio may cause CTC alignment issues

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor CTC loss convergence during baseline training (Week 3)
- Prepare fallback: Attention-based sequence modeling

## 5. Week 2 Recommendations

Based on Week 1 findings, here's the recommended path forward:

### 5.1 Immediate Actions (Week 2 Days 1-2)

1. **Complete Offline Feature Extraction**
   - Extract features for all 4,376 training samples
   - Extract dev (111) and test (180) splits
   - Estimated time: ~48 hours compute time
   - Run as background process or on more powerful machine

2. **Targeted EDA** (as originally planned)
   - Temporal analysis: Sign duration distribution
   - Spatial analysis: Keypoint stability/jitter
   - Vocabulary analysis: Class imbalance strategies
   - Feature discriminability: Can pose/hands alone suffice?

### 5.2 Architecture Decisions (Week 2 Days 3-4)

Based on 13.87 FPS finding:

**Option A: Offline-Only Training** (Recommended)
- Pre-extract all features
- Train on cached features (no real-time constraint)
- Optimize inference separately later
- Pros: No compromise on training quality
- Cons: Delays real-time validation

**Option B: Immediate Optimization**
- Reduce MediaPipe complexity now
- Re-extract with optimized settings
- Validate 30+ FPS before proceeding
- Pros: Real-time feasibility proven early
- Cons: May compromise feature quality

**Recommendation**: **Option A** - Pre-extract all features for training, address real-time optimization during Phase III (Deployment)

### 5.3 Baseline Planning (Week 2 Days 5-7)

Proceed with simplified BiLSTM-CTC baseline as planned:
- Input: Pre-extracted MediaPipe features (1662 dims)
- Architecture: Linear(256) ‚Üí BiLSTM(2 layers, 256 hidden) ‚Üí Linear(vocab_size) ‚Üí CTC
- Expected WER: 35-40% (lower bound)
- Training time: 2-4 hours
- This validates CTC convergence and establishes performance floor
