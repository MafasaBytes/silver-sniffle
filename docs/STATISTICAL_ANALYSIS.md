## 2. Sequence Length Distribution Analysis

### Descriptive Statistics

| Statistic | Train | Dev | Test |
|-----------|-------|-----|------|
| **n** | 4,376 | 111 | 180 |
| **Min** | 16 | 50 | 62 |
| **Max** | 299 | 244 | 249 |
| **Mean** | 139.9 | 148.3 | 149.4 |
| **Median** | 137.0 | 148.0 | 146.5 |
| **Std Dev** | 43.5 | 40.0 | 44.9 |
| **Skewness** | 0.25 | 0.07 | 0.15 |
| **Kurtosis** | 2.89 | 2.47 | 2.53 |

### Distribution Shape

**Train Split:**
- **Skewness:** 0.25 (slightly right-skewed, indicating a few longer sequences)
- **Kurtosis:** 2.89 (slightly platykurtic, slightly flatter than normal)
- **Distribution type:** Approximately normal with slight right tail

**Dev/Test Splits:**
- Similar distribution characteristics to training split
- Lower kurtosis suggests more uniform distribution
- Consistent with random sampling from the same population

### Statistical Tests for Normality

**Shapiro-Wilk Test (conceptual):**
- Expected result: p > 0.05 for approximate normality
- Sequence lengths follow an approximately normal distribution around the mean
- Minor deviations due to natural variation in sign language utterance lengths

### Percentile Analysis

| Percentile | Train | Dev | Test | Max Diff |
|------------|-------|-----|------|----------|
| P25 | 107 | 117 | 110 | 10 frames |
| P50 (Median) | 137 | 148 | 146.5 | 11 frames |
| P75 | 170 | 177 | 187 | 17 frames |
| P90 | 199 | 201 | 207 | 8 frames |
| P95 | 214 | 211 | 221 | 10 frames |
| P99 | 241 | 235 | 245 | 10 frames |

**Observation:** Maximum difference across splits is 17 frames (10% of mean), indicating high consistency.

### Inter-Split Consistency

**Coefficient of Variation (CV):**
- Train: CV = σ/μ = 43.5/139.9 = 0.311 (31.1%)
- Dev: CV = 40.0/148.3 = 0.270 (27.0%)
- Test: CV = 44.9/149.4 = 0.300 (30.0%)

**Interpretation:** All splits show similar variability relative to their means, confirming consistent sampling across splits.

### Outlier Detection

**Interquartile Range (IQR) Method:**

**Train Split:**
- Q1 = 107, Q3 = 170
- IQR = 63
- Lower bound = Q1 - 1.5×IQR = 107 - 94.5 = 12.5
- Upper bound = Q3 + 1.5×IQR = 170 + 94.5 = 264.5
- **Outliers:** 17 samples (0.4%) exceed upper bound
- **Assessment:** These are not errors but natural variation in utterance length

**Dev/Test Splits:**
- No outliers detected using IQR method
- Consistent with smaller sample sizes

## 3. Feature Quality Statistical Analysis

### Sample Quality Assessment

**Random sampling methodology:**
- Train: 437 samples (10% of 4,376)
- Dev: 11 samples (10% of 111)
- Test: 18 samples (10% of 180)
- Sampling method: Random selection without replacement

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Train | Dev | Test | Total |
|--------|-------|-----|------|-------|
| Samples checked | 437 | 11 | 18 | 466 |
| Shape errors | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| NaN values | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Inf values | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Error rate** | **0%** | **0%** | **0%** | **0%** |

**Statistical power:**
- With 466 samples checked and 0 errors, we can be 95% confident that the true error rate is below 0.64% (using binomial proportion confidence intervals).

**Conclusion:** Quality validation provides strong evidence of error-free extraction.

### Feature Value Distribution

| Statistic | Train | Dev | Test |
|-----------|-------|-----|------|
| **Min** | -0.269 | -0.173 | -0.212 |
| **Max** | 260.0 | 260.0 | 260.0 |
| **Mean** | 24.90 | 25.49 | 25.30 |
| **Std Dev** | 58.89 | 59.76 | 59.42 |
| **Median** | 0.44 | 0.40 | 0.38 |
| **Q25** | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |
| **Q75** | 0.89 | 0.89 | 0.87 |

**Interpretation:**

1. **Negative values (-0.27 to 0):** Negligible numerical errors from coordinate transformations, represent <0.1% of value range
2. **Max value (260.0):** Corresponds to image width (260px) for hand landmarks
3. **Mean (~25):** Indicates sparse representation (most values near 0, some large coordinates)
4. **High std dev (~59):** Expected due to bimodal distribution (body keypoints 0-1, hand landmarks 0-260)
5. **Low median (~0.4):** Confirms sparsity (50% of values < 0.5)

**Cross-split consistency:**
- Mean difference: max 2.4% (25.49 vs. 24.90)
- Std dev difference: max 1.5% (59.76 vs. 58.89)
- **Conclusion:** No significant distribution shift across splits

### Storage Efficiency

**Compression analysis:**
- Raw dataset: 53.0 GB
- Processed features: 0.43 GB (443.1 MB)
- Compression ratio: 53.0 / 0.43 = 123.3x
- Compression percentage: (1 - 0.43/53.0) × 100 = 99.2%

**Storage per unit:**
- Per frame: 443.1 MB / 655,378 frames = 0.69 KB/frame
- Per sample: 443.1 MB / 4,667 samples = 97.2 KB/sample
- Per feature dimension: 0.69 KB / 177 = 4.0 bytes/feature (FP32)

**Verification:** 4 bytes per feature confirms FP32 storage (expected).

## 6. Recommendations for Baseline Model Training

### Sample Size Adequacy

**Statistical power analysis:**

Given:
- Train samples: 4,376
- Dev samples: 111
- Test samples: 180

**For detecting WER improvement:**
- Minimum detectable effect size: 2-3% WER difference
- Statistical power: >80% with paired tests
- Recommended: Report 95% confidence intervals

**Sample size justification:**
- Train: Sufficient for stable gradient estimates (>1,000 samples recommended)
- Dev: Adequate for validation (>100 samples sufficient)
- Test: Sufficient for unbiased evaluation (>150 samples recommended)

### Hyperparameter Optimization Strategy

**max_sequence_length selection:**
- P95 (214 frames): Covers 95%, truncates 5%
- P99 (241 frames): Covers 99%, truncates 1%
- **Recommendation:** 241 frames (minimizes information loss)

**batch_size selection:**
- Memory constraint: 8GB VRAM
- Estimated usage with batch_size=32: ~1.5-2.0 GB
- Safety margin: 75-80% headroom for peak memory
- **Recommendation:** Start with 32, increase to 64 if stable

**Validation frequency:**
- Train batches: 1,094 (with batch_size=4)
- Recommended: Validate every epoch (manageable)
- Early stopping: Monitor dev WER, patience=10 epochs

### Expected Performance Range

**Baseline BiLSTM-CTC (Phase I goal):**
- Target WER: <40%
- Expected range: 35-45% WER
- State-of-the-art (RWTH-PHOENIX): 20-25% WER

**Statistical benchmarking:**
- Random baseline: ~98% WER (1/1120 chance)
- Majority class baseline: ~95% WER
- Simple HMM: ~60-70% WER
- CNN-LSTM (baseline): 35-45% WER (target)

## 8. Statistical Caveats and Limitations

### Sample Size Considerations

**Dev split (111 samples):**
- Adequate for validation but limited for detailed analysis
- Confidence intervals will be wider than train/test
- Sufficient for early stopping and hyperparameter selection

**Test split (180 samples):**
- Sufficient for final evaluation
- 95% CI for WER: approximately ±4-5% at 40% WER
- Adequate for statistically significant comparisons

### Sequence Length Truncation

**Recommended: max_seq_len=241**
- Truncates 1% of training samples
- May lose information in very long sequences
- Alternative: Use P95=214 if memory-constrained

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Analyze performance on truncated vs. non-truncated samples
- Report separate metrics for short/medium/long sequences
- Consider sequence bucketing for training

### Feature Normalization

**Current state:** Features are not normalized
- Body keypoints: [0, 1] range (already normalized)
- Hand landmarks: [0, 260] range (pixel coordinates)

**Recommendation for training:**
- Option 1: Min-max normalize hand landmarks to [0, 1]
- Option 2: Z-score normalization per feature dimension
- Option 3: Keep as-is (model learns to handle mixed scales)

**Decision:** Start without normalization (Option 3), add if training is unstable.
