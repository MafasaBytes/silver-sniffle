# FPS Documentation Corrections Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Issue:** Multiple documentation files incorrectly claimed "30.0 FPS" for feature extraction
**Root Cause:** Hardcoded duration in `analyze_extraction_performance.py` instead of using actual measurements

---

## Correct FPS Measurements

Based on **VALIDATION_REPORT.md** (the source of truth):

### **Feature Extraction Performance (Actual)**
- **Per-worker FPS:** 16.0 frames/second (average across 2 workers)
- **Aggregate throughput:** 32.1 frames/second (2 workers combined)
- **Baseline (single-threaded):** 7.7 frames/second
- **Per-worker speedup:** 2.08x (108% faster than baseline)
- **Parallel efficiency:** 104% (near-linear scaling with 2 workers)
- **Aggregate speedup:** 4.17x vs. baseline

### **Train Split Details**
- Frames: 612,027
- Duration: 317.1 minutes (19,026 seconds) with 2 parallel workers
- Wall-clock time: ~5h 17min

### **Important Distinctions**
- **Extraction FPS** (actual): 16.0 per worker, 32 aggregate → **Feature extraction phase**
- **Inference FPS target** (30+ FPS): **Phase III goal** (real-time deployment) → CORRECT, don't change

## Files Corrected

### ✅ **1. `scripts/analyze_extraction_performance.py`** - COMPLETED
**Changes made:**
- Removed hardcoded `train_duration_minutes = 5 * 60 + 40`
- Now uses actual measured time: `317.1 minutes` from VALIDATION_REPORT.md
- Added `num_workers = 2` parameter
- Calculates both per-worker FPS (16.0) and aggregate throughput (32.1)
- Updated all output messages to distinguish per-worker vs. aggregate
- Fixed recommendations section (e.g., "3 workers → 48 FPS aggregate")

**Key formula changes:**
```python
# OLD:
actual_fps = train_frames / train_duration_seconds

# NEW:
per_worker_fps = train_frames / train_duration_seconds / num_workers  # 16.0 FPS
aggregate_fps = train_frames / train_duration_seconds  # 32.1 FPS
```

## Files Requiring Manual Correction

### ⏳ **4. `docs/VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md`**
**Lines to fix:**
- **Line 45:** "Actual FPS: 30.0 frames/second"
  → "Actual FPS: 16.0 frames/second per worker (32 FPS aggregate with 2 workers)"

- **Line 230:** "Why 30 FPS vs. 7.7 FPS Estimate?"
  → "Why 16 FPS per worker vs. 7.7 FPS Estimate?"

- **Line 233:** "1. **YOLOv8 > MediaPipe** for GPU efficiency"
  (Context needs updating to reflect parallel processing)

- **Line 241:** "Observed 30 FPS → ~10-20% GPU utilization"
  → "Observed 16 FPS per worker → ~16% per worker, 32% effective with 2 workers"

- **Line 249:** "Batch video processing: 20-30 FPS potential"
  → "Batch video processing: With 3 workers, 48 FPS aggregate; with 4 workers, 64 FPS aggregate"

---

### ⏳ **5. `ROADMAP.md`**
**Lines to fix (preserve "30+ FPS" inference targets):**

**Lines mentioning extraction performance (CHANGE THESE):**
- **Line 28:** "30.0 FPS average (3.9x faster than 7.7 FPS estimate)"
  → "16.0 FPS per worker, 32 FPS aggregate (2 workers; 2.08x per-worker speedup)"

- **Line 110:** "Extraction logs show consistent FPS ✅ 30.0 FPS average"
  → "Extraction logs show consistent FPS ✅ 16.0 FPS per worker (32 FPS aggregate)"

- **Line 118:** "Performance: 30.0 FPS (3.9x faster than 7.7 FPS estimate)"
  → "Performance: 16.0 FPS per worker (32 FPS aggregate, 2.08x per-worker speedup)"

- **Line 480:** "Performance: 30.0 FPS on RTX 4070 (3.9x faster!)"
  → "Performance: 16.0 FPS per worker on RTX 4070 (32 FPS aggregate with 2 workers)"

- **Line 658:** Table row: "| **Extraction FPS** | 7-10 | ✅ 30.0 | ✅ 3.9x faster than target! |"
  → "| **Extraction FPS** | 7-10 | ✅ 16.0 (per worker), 32 (aggregate) | ✅ 2.08x per worker, 4.17x aggregate! |"

**Lines mentioning inference targets (KEEP THESE AS-IS):**
- Line 6, 12, 70, 146, 393, 413, 419, 513, 646, 686, 866, 895 - All mention "30+ FPS" as a **Phase III inference target** → CORRECT, don't change

---

### ⏳ **6. ` VALIDATION_REPORT.md`**
**Status:** This file is already CORRECT! It contains the source-of-truth measurements:
- Line 24: "16.0 FPS average" ✓
- Line 274: Train FPS: 16.1, Dev: 15.9, Test: 15.1, Average: 16.0 ✓

**Action:** NO CHANGES NEEDED - Use this file as reference

## Verification Checklist

After making all corrections, verify:

- [ ] All "30.0 FPS" extraction claims replaced with "16.0 FPS per worker" or "32 FPS aggregate"
- [ ] Speedup claims updated: "3.9x" → "2.08x per worker" or "4.17x aggregate"
- [ ] Parallel processing context explained (2 workers, near-linear scaling)
- [ ] "30+ FPS" **inference targets** for Phase III remain unchanged
- [ ] Performance claims traceable to VALIDATION_REPORT.md measurements
- [ ] Scripts (`analyze_extraction_performance.py`) use actual measured times, not hardcoded values

---

## Key Lessons Learned

### Statistical Rigor Requirements:
1. **Never hardcode measurements** - Always use actual logged/measured values
2. **Distinguish per-worker vs. aggregate metrics** in parallel processing contexts
3. **Separate extraction FPS from inference FPS** - these are different phases
4. **Include context** - State number of workers, hardware, measurement conditions
5. **Trace claims to evidence** - All performance claims must reference source data

### Correct Reporting Format:
```markdown
**Feature Extraction Performance:**
- Per-worker FPS: 16.0 frames/second (each of 2 workers)
- Aggregate throughput: 32.1 frames/second (wall-clock time)
- Baseline (single-threaded): 7.7 FPS
- Per-worker speedup: 2.08x (108% improvement)
- Parallel efficiency: 104% (near-linear scaling)
- Hardware: NVIDIA RTX 4070, 2 parallel workers
```

## Impact on Thesis

### What this changes:
- **Methods section:** Correctly report extraction performance with parallel processing context
- **Results section:** Accurate speedup claims (2.08x, not 3.9x)
- **Discussion section:** Explain parallel scaling efficiency (104%)

### What this does NOT change:
- **Phase III inference targets:** 30+ FPS real-time inference goal is still valid
- **Overall conclusions:** Extraction was still efficient and successful
- **Research contributions:** Parallel processing demonstrates good engineering practices
